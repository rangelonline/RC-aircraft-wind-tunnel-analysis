# RC-aircraft-wind-tunnel-analysis
This repository is built on the work done for my aerospce engineering senior design course at Texas A&M University. Student team ATLAS designed a general aviation aircraft in senior design's first semester before building a 1:6 scale RC version for wind tunnel and flight tests.
